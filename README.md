# Commiting code to github (push)
- ensure you have the repository cloned to your workspace
- navigate to the project folder of the code you're trying to change/view in your IDE
- when going to edit code, open the file straight from the location you cloned the repository to (ie repo/project/cources/x.c or whatever)
- SAVE YOUR CHANGES
- once you've done so, using either github desktop or command line, commit your changes and add a title/message to your commit so we can roll back code if necessary
- make sure to pull cofe prior to making changes to ensure you're working on the most recent code

## Github Desktop
If you're unfamiliar with git, it might be easiest to use the desktop client rather than using terminals/zip files from the web client.  

### installation
