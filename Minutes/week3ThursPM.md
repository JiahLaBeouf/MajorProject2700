## Apologies
Jadon Routley

## Meeting goals
- Progress PDF report
- Redelegate some tasks, and also creation of a few new tasks as well

## Previous actions
- Meeting again for Thursday 12/5 updates as the meeting was passed over
- Motor code is looking good, some development with the LiDAR data retrieved from the board
- First looks at the data sent from the board to the machine via serial
- Slight redelegation to try and make up for the tasks with less definition

## Regular items
- Redevelop understanding of how we want to use the magnetometer in the project design.
- Work out a few issues in understanding how the motor works in this system, as previous understanding was a bit off. With a bit of testing, it makes more sense and can move on to more complex tasks.
- Starting to serialise a bit more data, and pushing more code to git to be able to round trip code from dev to testing

## New items
- Everyone continuing their delegated tasks
- Jadon and Oscar to have next weekend away, will aim to finish by then
- Renewed focus into using python/matlab for post-data collection analysis and visualisation
- all to rewatch live lecture to get a better sense on how to serialise and work with the data and the imu board.

## AOB
