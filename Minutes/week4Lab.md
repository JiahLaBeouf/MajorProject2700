## Apologies


## Meeting goals
- Begin powerpoint
- Motor testing with board
- Refactoring inputs for motor functions
- Including LIDAR and magnetometer code into working project

## Previous actions
- Redevelop understanding of how we want to use the magnetometer in the project design.
- Work out a few issues in understanding how the motor works in this system, as previous understanding was a bit off. With a bit of testing, it makes more sense and can move on to more complex tasks.
- Starting to serialise a bit more data, and pushing more code to git to be able to round trip code from dev to testing
- Completed and submitted PDF progress report

## Regular items
- Inclusion of new motor code
- Inclusion of display code
- Added drivers for magnetometer and gyro
- Changing LIDAR code and testing on the board
- Powerpoint started by Joe, need to include all components of the design

## New items
- Everyone continuing their delegated tasks
